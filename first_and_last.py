Exercise 5: Check if the first and last number of a list is the same
Write a function to return True if the first and last number of a given list is same. If numbers are different then return False.

Given:

numbers_x = [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
numbers_y = [75, 65, 35, 75, 30]
Expected Output:

Given list: [10, 20, 30, 40, 10]
result is True

numbers_y = [75, 65, 35, 75, 30]
result is False
